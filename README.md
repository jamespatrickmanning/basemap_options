# basemap_options
options to plot coast and bathymetry for the NE US shelf
Note: There are miscellaeous code in this repo that do not really belong in bathy but they are here for now.

The most recent code uses "Cartopy" instead of "Basemap" utilities. See "bathy_gebco_example.py" for example to see shaded contour of GOM w/insert map.
In addition ""bathy_gebco_area.py" decides where and scale to plot based on input data that is posted as scatter.
